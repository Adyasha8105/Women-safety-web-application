# Women Safety Application 
A Dynamic web project for women safety and security with auto location tracking.
### Present Day scenario

In India Sati, Sabitri, Durga, Laxmi are worshipped by
people treating them as goddesses where as there is
increasing number of violence against women. The
amount of violence against women has increased by many
fold due to the greater exposure of women in every field of
life. Women were previously restricted to the four walls of
the houses and after globalisation they have got the
chances and opportunities to stand equally in all sectors at
par with male. Women are now a days cab drivers and
they are also the CEO of top companies.
It is a good sign that the patriarchal mind set of the society
has changed to some extent but not to the extent it was
supposed to. It is the same mind set that restricts women
to go out and work making them as a tool for
domestication. It is the same mind set that treats males as
superior than female and always try to dominate the
women folk.
In order to improve women safety in India the first
task is to improve the number of women in every
sphere of society. Along with that the change in
mind set of people is very essential for the safety of
women. From family to educational institutions men
should be taught about respecting females. Further,
there should be fast-track courts to hear the cases
and they cases should be investigated in a time
bound manner. Only strict laws can not solve the

problem of women safety in India rather the
implementation of these laws in a time bound
manner can solve the issue to a large extent.
